# JC3503 - Data Mining & Visualisation (2023/2024)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the materials and final reports for my JC3503 Data Mining & Visualisation course, completed as part of my coursework at the University of Aberdeen. The project involved exploratory data analysis, data mining, and data visualization on two datasets.

## Project Title

**Data Mining and Visualization Assignments**

## Description

For this project, I analyzed two different datasets as part of the course requirements. The objective was to demonstrate my ability to manipulate, prepare, and analyze data sets, and to design appropriate visualization solutions. The final reports cover the analysis and findings from each dataset.

## Contents

- **Assignment Requirements**: Detailed instructions and guidelines provided by the university.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The Jupyter notebooks containing the code, analysis, and visualizations for each dataset.
- **Final Reports**: The completed reports in PDF format for each dataset.

## Files

- [Assignment Requirements (PDF)](JC3503_DMV_2023-2024_Assessment.pdf)
- [Apartments Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)](apartments.ipynb)
- [Student Records Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)](student_records.ipynb)

## Datasets

1. **Classifieds: Apartments for Rent**: Analysis of rental apartment listings.
2. **Students' Dropout and Academic Success**: Analysis of student academic records and dropout rates.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate the ability to determine appropriate methods for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data mining, and data visualization.
- Undertake these methods to explore, understand, and analyze the data at hand.

## Analysis Highlights

### Apartments for Rent

#### Challenges
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset contained numerous missing values and inconsistencies in data formats.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating meaningful features from the available data required significant effort.

#### Solutions
1. **Imputation and Standardization**: Used various imputation techniques to handle missing data and standardized the formats for consistency.
2. **Feature Creation**: Applied domain knowledge to generate new features, such as price per square meter and rental demand indices.

#### Key Findings
- **Price Trends**: Identified significant trends in rental prices based on location and apartment size.
- **Demand Analysis**: Discovered patterns in rental demand related to seasonality and regional factors.

### Student Records

#### Challenges
1. **Imbalanced Data**: The dataset was highly imbalanced, with a disproportionate number of students in different academic performance categories.
2. **Complex Relationships**: Uncovering the relationships between various factors influencing academic success required in-depth analysis.

#### Solutions
1. **Resampling Techniques**: Employed techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset for better model training.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Used correlation matrices and feature importance scores to identify key factors affecting student performance.

#### Key Findings
- **Predictive Indicators**: Determined that attendance and participation were strong indicators of academic success.
- **Dropout Risk Factors**: Identified high-risk factors for student dropouts, providing insights for potential interventions.
